<p><strong>Name:</strong>  Matthew Allen</p>
<p><strong>Student number:</strong>  *******</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong>  8th October 2020</p>
<p><strong><em>This is submitted for Assignment 1: Virtual Worlds of EG-M126 of the VR MSc for Swansea University.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Name of Virtual World:</strong>  Farm</p>
<p><strong>Link to Mozilla Hubs:</strong> https://hub.link/o6kS4xL</p>
<p><strong>Name of Submitted Build Zip:</strong> EGM126_A1_2031528_v1.zip</p>
<p><strong>Unity Version:</strong>  2019.4.10f1</p>
<p><strong>Tested on:</strong>  Windows Mixed Reality HMD (as provided) and ASUS ROG laptop (as provided)</p>
<p><strong>Short Description of Virtual World’s purpose:</strong><br>
The world has several purposes.  At its most basic it is a very simple immersive representation of a farm.  I wanted to do a VR world that was a “thing”.  A self-contained environment, comprised of familiar, recognisable components.  I felt this would lend itself to my (currently) quite limited skills but still allow scope for experimentation and skills development for me.  I immediately saw the opportunity to use sounds and text to enhance the visuals.<br>
This world (in a more developed form) could be used as an exploratory environment for smaller children who would (hopefully) like the cartoon like feel to the objects and the sounds, numbers and text would help facilitate both visual and aural recognition of the farm animals, and language and number skills in a friendly atmosphere.<br>
It could also be part of a suite of settings useful for second language development skills for students of all ages.  The range of objects in each scene would be expanded to offer a greater extension of vocabulary.  Different scenes could develop different vocabularies.  For older language students the animal sounds could also be extended / swapped to include pronunciations of the animal names.  It would also be possible to provide different languages by changing the text and sounds.  A cow is still a cow in a different language even if it is called something different.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Feature 1 Purpose:</strong><br>  Sound of the cow mooing.  Firstly, to see if I could do it.  Secondly (as alluded to above) the sound (as it currently stands) is central to the animal recognition aspect of the environment and to the extension of the environment’s use with language students.  Sound adds “presence” to VR experiences (Nordahl and Nilsson, 2014), enriching it in several different dimensions, and as such is an integral part of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Feature 2 Purpose:</strong><br>  Text labelling of animals.  Again, central to the idea of aiding the development of language skills.  Having the name and quantity of the animal displayed above it help to enable the recognition process.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
This has been quite a week.  All the learning I’ve done in the last 20 years or so has been self-directed and self-paced, so this has been my return to structured learning.  It has been quite busy !  It has also been very enjoyable.  I’ve been quite excited about the start of the course in the run up, but when it actually came to it, I was surprisingly intimidated by the whole thing.  Could I do it.  Was I going to make a fool of myself.  I’m pleased to say that at the end of the first week I’ve shown myself that I can and I won’t.<br>
To be honest, I did a farm in the first instance as I thought it was something I could do and add to.  But having done it, I started to see things that it could be used for in an educational setting.  I accept that it was a bit of a case of “here is a thing, what can I do with it” rather than “this is what I want to do, let me make something to enable me to do it”, so it is a bit cart before horse … but it does (to me at any rate) serve as a demonstration of the potency of this technology and how VR is such a powerful educational tool just waiting to be exploited.  I know that exposes the direction of my interests and agenda, but there you go.<br>
I found Unity to be quite a steep learning curve (then I saw Git this afternoon and Unity looks much more straight forward now), but I’ve enjoyed getting a bit more familiar with it.  I’ve done quite a bit of web work for years and all that looks much worse than it is to start with, so this will come – with use and practice.  I’ve had a few stumbles, for example issues with the animals moving to Mozilla – they all looked like albino rats.  The solution I was offered didn’t work (as I hadn’t given enough information really), but I managed to find another way of getting to an end product.<br>
I did not approach the project well, in terms or project management, which meant I made several mistakes and had false starts, which cost me considerable time.  In fact, it was not until I took stock part way through and put a plan in place that I made progress.</p>
